Companies like Google, Amazon, MS, OpenAI etc can add new services whatever they want (like OpenAI now making it possible to buy online through ChatGPT), however, there are a few things they will not very soon be able to:
- Provide the user a feeling of trust
- Get access to a **combination of user data**, like AI chats, personal chats, personal files, biometric data etc.
- Let people query each others combined data with **owner controlled mechanisms**
- Having **access to everyone's or region specific Pods** (only relevant if they become important)
- Adding **user specified filters** to incoming messages that recognize family members
- Being **resilient to power or internet outages**
- Being able to **survive** in their current form without collecting user data
