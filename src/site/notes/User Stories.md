Some fictional inducing user stories, curated by ChatGPT. It is mostly speculation/dreaming, but maybe it can spark some enthusiasm.

### Developers

As a developer, you it would be great to build services on much richer user data, without putting data safety at risk.  By adopting Solid Pods, you can help create a future where data is no longer owned by big tech companies, but by individuals themselves. With these Solid Pods, users can store their data securely and retain full control over who accesses it and how it’s used. This way, services don’t own the data—they just access it with permission, helping build a safer, more transparent digital world. A great advantage for you as a developer is that it safes you from any legal data management compliance headaches.

### **Users**

#### Social Media Users

Social Media manipulate users, demanding their attention all the time and making them socially anxious. What if you could control by yourselves how to interact with your friends, without having the dilemma of losing online friends by switching some social medium altogether? With Solid Pods you not only gain control over your data, but you control how you and your friends interact too! Some ideas:
- users can just turn off any feature, because they decide how people interact with them. Are you anxious of likes? Just turn them off
- is the algorithm feeding you with posts that make you unhappy? Just change the algorithm.

- more speculative: as your data is safe, and not controlled by some dubious company, you can share it with any service you like. Do you want advice of an AI on your social media usage? Just ask your personalized AI. As nothing that your share with your private AI will be send to some company, you can share your posts, usage stats, virtually anything with it.

#### Privacy Oriented Users

With Solid Pods, you can use services without giving up your personal information or letting it be misused. You can automate tasks or dive into your own documents with AI while ensuring your privacy is protected. This gives you more power and clarity over how your data is shared, who has access to it, and how it's used to enhance your experience online.


#### Individuals Seeking Better Data Management

As a user, you want to easily find specific photos, such as those featuring yourself and a family member. With your Solid Pod, you can send a simple request asking for all the photos containing that person, and you’ll receive a series of thumbnails. From there, you can quickly download the ones you need, or add them to your family Pod. No hassle anymore with different cloud services that are incompatible.

Additionally, you can use this feature with someone else’s Pod, like a family member or friend. To ensure privacy, smart AI filters can help identify and prevent sharing of sensitive content.

AI can assist in matching individuals with the right resources, making local connections more efficient and meaningful.

### Local Community Members
