## Intro
The idea of this project is to make a strategy and a start for implementing the idea of Solid Pods into a usable online digital infrastructure. To keep things clear, the project is split into two phases.

## [[Project Design/Phase I\|Phase I]]

The first phase has two goals:
- Getting experience with developing for Solid Pods by ourselves
- Conceiving a promising strategy to accelerate the development and adaptation of Solid Pods

My estimation is that the first phase should take about 0.5 - 2 years

## [[Project Design/Phase II\|Phase II]]

The second phase builds on phase I. Right now, it is just the development of other critical functionality for improving adaptation.

## [[Project Design/Phase III\|Phase III]]

This is just a collection of future ideas
