This group of documents describes the initial framework for advancing the Solid Pod ideology into a functional infrastructure for both online and local communities. While the best way is to start small, I think it is important to have an idea of the bigger picture and a discussion about it from the very start. That is why there are so many small ideas clustered together into this web of ideas.

It is separated into different parts:

1. In the [[Project Design/Project Design\|Project Design]] a proposal is sketched of how to shape the different steps to realize this Solid-based online infrastructure
2. The project needs to deliver different products, which are described in the directory 'Product Design'. Most of them are referenced to in the Project Design. Note: the split between Main Functions and Services can feel a bit fuzzy, it is just a rough grouping.
3. As the ambitiousness of this project demands funding, while there is no clear business model from the start, I have added thoughts about potential business models that can profit from this ideology under [[Possible Compatible Products and Business Models\|Possible Compatible Products and Business Models]]
4. For most people it is not ideology, but functionality that makes them enthusiastic - which is necessary for collecting commitment and funding. Therefore I also sketched some [[User Stories\|User Stories]].
