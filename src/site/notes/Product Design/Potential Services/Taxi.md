This is just an example, it is in fact very similar to the [[Product Design/Potential Services/Odd-Job Sharing\|Odd-Job Sharing]] service. Point is that you could offer different skills/services as a user, that are then indexed by pods that are connected to your neighborhood. As you don't some account for some specific service, it is much easier for people to offer their services to anyone around.
