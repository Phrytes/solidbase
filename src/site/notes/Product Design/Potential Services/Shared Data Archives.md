A very promising app would be to combine data of multiple users into a separate shared pod. Think of family archives containing photo's, videos, scanned ancestor diaries, birth certificates, etc. 

Right now, it is harder for friends and family to easily share this kind of data centrally, as they all use different services that are not compatible.

This could also lead to new companies that digitize family archives, putting everything in a pod and then offering the credentials to family members - without any vendor lock-in.
