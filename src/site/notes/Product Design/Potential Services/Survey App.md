With third party computation, it would be possible to query swaths of people without exposing their personal data. Volunteers could therefore share their characteristics, which can help scientists or policy makers to take a fairly random, but balanced sample.

This could improve both local decision making/policy making as scientific research.

It would of course only be useful after mass adaptation of this infrastructure.
