Ideally, Solid Pods should be able to run locally on your device (supported by the [syncing](Syncing) functionality between pods). If these would be able to connect to each other for example by p2p (through WiFi-Direct, or even Bluetooth), it would become possible to set up local networks that can still function in times of internet or power outages.
