- necessary for enforcing user permissions
- especially for controlling API access
- needs to be trustworthy

Example:
Say, I want to share a picture with you, you can only see it when you connect to this service, and I will tell the service when I want the access to be revoked.

Also useful for computations that are too intense for local processing or when data of multiple users is involved (or maybe data from the app)

Can also function as a way make a handshake: I only share this with you when you share that with me

Also essential for sharing data anonymously, which is very useful for policy makers, researchers, investigators etc
