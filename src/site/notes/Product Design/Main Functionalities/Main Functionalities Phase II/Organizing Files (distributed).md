Files on cloud services must be available through the pod too:
- Complete syncing if necessary
- Or just references (maybe with a local thumbnail)

Must become compatible with many cloud services

Also: if a file is deleted or moved in the source, the state should change in the pod

Examples:
- [Solid‑Nextcloud App ](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/solid)
