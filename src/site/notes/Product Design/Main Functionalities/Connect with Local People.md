Very important to make Solid Pods successful: if you get functionality that traditional internet barely offers (because your data is always isolated on some servers of some company), it will help advancing adaptation

With solid pods you can share data passively to anyone who is interested. Like your skills, available tools, hobbies etc. Not many people want to share this in some huge social network. However, sharing it locally is way more attractive, especially when you know your data will not be stolen by untrustworthy parties
