In another project I'm trying to make a universal, json-based definition for creating pipelines. If this would ever work, then, in theory, an LLM should be able to generate such pipelines with textual input.
Other functionality should include events, triggers and scheduling.

This could help democratize data-science or IoT automation.

Web crawling would be great as well later, if still relevant.
