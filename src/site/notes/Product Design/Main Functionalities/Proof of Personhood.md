Similar to [[Product Design/Main Functionalities/Proof of Location\|Proof of Location]]

But now for proving you are a real person. Could be useful to prevent unauthorized agents to take part of some online data sharing service

- could be implemented differently for different regions, but I think some core functions overlap
- could be done in different degrees: 
	- proving of location could be seen as a proof of personhood
	- for local voting, your (reference to your) personal ID could be entered, with MFA
